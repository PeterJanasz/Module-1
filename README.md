# Module-1

## Coded By: Peter Janasz

## Description

In this Module 1 activity we were given a non semantic code with a working website and were instructed to make it more semantic. I began by making comments in the HTML and CSS style sheets to organize the changes I wanted to make. I then refactored the original code by replacing the div elements with appropriate semantic elements such as, header, nav, figure, article, aside, and footer. In addition, I renamed the CSS selectors from class to element selectors to simplify and consolidate the code. The footer had an h2 element that was changed to h4. The website functions the same as before, but with a more reader friendly semantic code.
